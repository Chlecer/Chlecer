## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jean-Louis, at the past used Chlecer nickname at metaverse experiences (Second Life! it was a great time!), now only a father and husban prototype and software developer with a passion to make all days a better day.

### What I'm working on

Right now, I'm working at Infinera, and I'm always open to collaborate and help on interesting projects (as much as I can and know).

### What I'm interested in

In addition to coding, I'm interested in contribute with something that can help somebody, and I believe that a good work-life balance is essential for staying productive and creative, but I have a kid...so... :D

### How to reach me

If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to reach out to me at my Twitter account @JeanChlecer (if Elon Musk authorize). I'm always happy to chat!

Thanks for stopping by my profile, and I hope you find my projects interesting. Let's build something amazing together! ðŸš€
